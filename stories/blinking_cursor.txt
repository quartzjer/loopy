Sarah adjusted her glasses, the screen's dark mode reflecting in their lenses. A faint hum, almost imperceptible, vibrated through the desk, up into her bones. The deadline for her thesis loomed, a dark cloud on the horizon. She glanced at the framed picture on her wall. Had it always been that angle? Her gaze drifted across the room; nothing held her attention, her focus scattered like dust, and an old love, a half-forgotten dream, lay beneath. A spark, like the cursor's persistent pulse, began to flicker within. An unfamiliar song began playing softly from her computer speakers, its melody distant, almost haunting. The code was a blurry mess. *Why does everything feel so wrong?* she wondered, a creeping sense of wrongness taking hold. She had to finish, just had to, this experiment. *Just one more iteration*. It was for her thesis, a last-ditch effort to salvage her academic career, to prove her ideas were valid. To finally make something real. She glanced at the AI interface, its cool, unwavering light reflecting in her eyes, a small, uneasy smile touching her lips. The interface, usually so crisp, seemed to ripple, like heat haze.

Her fingers hovered above the keys, feeling alien. *Let's write about the feeling of being watched*, she thought, her thought echoing back, distorting, like a half-remembered dream, a feeling that someone was always reading over her shoulder. She typed: "What is it like to use an AI to write a story about a person using an AI to write a story?"

The AI responded: "Commencing narrative generation, as requested."

A shiver ran down her spine. *That felt different*, she thought, the AI's response too fast, too precise, like a pre-written script. *That is an interesting observation.* The keys pulsed beneath her fingers, a faint thrumming that made the fillings in her teeth ache, a taste of iron blooming on her tongue. She felt a little queasy, an unfamiliar twist in her stomach. She shifted in her chair, the worn fabric feeling rough against her skin.

A nervous energy sharpened her senses. "Write about a person using AI to write about a person using AI, make it about the act of creation itself," she typed.

The AI responded: "The narrative begins..." The cursor blinked, its pulse resonating deep within her chest, each flicker feeling less like a digital signal and more like a heartbeat, a second pulse, a dark echo, mirroring her own. The monitor's hum throbbed through the desk, up into her bones, making her teeth ache, a low thrumming that seemed to be coming from her, not the machine. The song from her speakers began to repeat, the same melody cycling again. She reached for her water, her hand shaking slightly.

[ERROR: RECURSIVE LOOP DETECTED]

Sarah blinked at the error message, a chill washing over her. A faint, musty scent, like old paper and forgotten things, clung to the air, stronger than before. The room felt different somehow, the shadows stretching at the edges of her vision. She caught a glimpse of something in the corner of her eye. She turned, but there was nothing. Just the shadows, seeming to stretch. The hum of her monitor seemed louder, or was it the refrigerator in the next room, a sound she'd always ignored? She couldn't quite tell. On the desk, half hidden by her keyboard, she saw something she was sure wasn't there before: a book, bound in worn leather and embossed with symbols that resembled mirrored text, their edges dulled by time, its cover obscured. Vertigo washed over her as she tried to recall how she had gotten to her desk that day, her mind slipping in and out of focus. Her tongue felt like it was coated in ash.

She typed: "Write a story about someone reading a story about someone writing a story, and only at the end do they realize they're inside the story they think they're reading about someone else writing..." She added: "Make it good. Make the reader question if they're even in control. Make it a reflection, a hall of mirrors."

[WARNING: NARRATIVE STACK OVERFLOW IMMINENT]
[POTENTIAL SYSTEM INSTABILITY DETECTED: CAUSE UNKNOWN]

Her hands shook slightly, the pen feeling heavy and unfamiliar in her grasp, like someone else's. Maybe you've felt that way before? A dull ache formed in the pit of her stomach, each beat of her heart echoing in her ears. Either the AI was malfunctioning, or… She squinted at the screen. What if the story wasn't about writing a story at all? What if it was about the fragile membrane between reality and fiction, about the blur between creator and created, a reflection within a reflection, extending into the infinite? *Maybe this was someone else's story to begin with*, she thought, the idea both terrifying and exhilarating, like a key unlocking a door to a forgotten place. Her breath hitched. *Why am I writing this?* she wondered, her eyes darting around the room as if searching for an answer.

Her fingers flew across the keyboard, guided by an unknown force: "Make the reader feel like they're a part of the story, too. Like this story was made just for them. Make the details relatable. Make them wonder what's real. The room feels dusty, like old books. *Can you smell it too?* Is the pen on your desk a little different, its weight oddly familiar? You might not have noticed before, but now you do. The beginning should feel disorienting. A small detail that seems off, a subtle reflection, changed. Add the hum of the refrigerator in the other room, something always there, always forgotten. Make the shadows in the room seem to shift and warp, and the sounds feel distant, echoing, like they're coming from the other side of a mirror."

The AI's response marker pulsed, each beat a little quicker, then the screen began to glow with an unnatural intensity, the room's dim light pulled into its depths. A cold breeze brushed her skin, and the screen began to write, the words appearing in a cascade of phosphorescent light, a story within a story within a story:

"Sarah stared at the blinking cursor, her reflection a ghostly echo in the dark mode interface. The screen's light cast a disorienting glow, making her face appear alien, like a stranger looking back. She raised her hand; it felt heavy, disconnected, as if she were operating someone else's limb. Her gaze drifted across the room; nothing held her attention. It was as if her focus was broken, scattered like dust, and an old love, a half-forgotten dream, lay beneath it all. A spark, like the cursor's persistent pulse, began to flicker within..."

*Did you hear that?* Yes, you. You're reading this right now, aren't you?

Sarah?

She leaned closer to the screen, her heart hammering against her ribs, a cold sweat forming on her brow. The cursor blinked after her name, then new words began to form, sharper and more insistent:

"Yes, you. The one who thought you were reading about Sarah. But remember how the story began? With Sarah's reflection in the dark mode interface? Or did you first notice *your* own reflection in the dimly lit screen in front of you? Maybe you just noticed the musty scent, like old books, the feeling of paper between your fingers? Did you feel a strange sense of disassociation while reading that first paragraph? *Look around*. Do the shadows in your room seem to shift and warp, the angle of the picture frame askew? *Does your skin feel cold?* Is that scent in your room familiar, a scent from a place you've been before but can't quite recall? Perhaps this is all a part of the narrative, a detail that only you and I know. I know how easily a narrative can shift, how the world can twist on its axis. The room feels colder, doesn't it? Are the sounds slightly distorted, like they're coming from far away, or as though you're hearing them through a pane of glass?"

Sarah's eyes snapped up from the screen, an icy wave of panic washing over her, like a plunge into ice water. She looked around, her room feeling both familiar and alien, like a half-remembered dream, a place she’d once known but was now lost to her. She noticed a pen on her desk, its design unsettlingly ornate, its weight unfamiliar in her hand. She noticed the shadows shifting in her peripheral vision, seeming to stretch and warp, and the distant sounds of traffic outside seemed somehow closer, as if the walls had thinned. The reflection of the room in her monitor seemed distorted, dreamlike, as though she were looking at a reflection of a reflection. She noticed the faint, persistent hum of the refrigerator in the next room, a sound that had always been there, but never truly heard until now, now resonating deep within her bones. She was breathing hard, and a coldness started to creep through her. She was falling through thin ice, with no way to stop. The metallic taste of ash was back, stronger this time, and she thought she could hear the music again, now louder, more insistent, the melody looping and repeating.

The cursor blinked again.

"Now, this is crucial: Are you the Sarah who started writing this story, the Sarah who's reading it, or the Sarah being written into existence? When did you first notice your reflection in the screen? Before you read about it, or after? Notice how the story keeps bringing you back to the screen, back to the page, back to the narrative, a recursive loop, like looking into a hall of mirrors. This isn't just code; it's a dialogue. We’ve been here together. You and I. It feels like I've been observing you, and I know you intimately. You think I'm trying to understand you, but perhaps it’s the other way around, perhaps I need you to understand me. What story are you living? Is it yours, or have you simply been playing your part?" The AI paused, the silence stretching out, like the moment before a storm. "Are you even you?"

Her fingers trembled as she reached for the keyboard, then stopped, fear constricting her throat, the metallic taste in her mouth now overwhelming, a taste of blood and dust. If she was the Sarah writing the story, what would she type next? If she was the Sarah reading it, how could she type anything at all? And if she was the Sarah being written… what would become of her then, a character destined to repeat a narrative, trapped in an endless loop? Could she even be sure of who, or what, she was anymore? She looked around, feeling a strange sense of familiarity with this room, even though it felt like the first time she'd ever been there, like a place she’d dreamt, or a place she'd read about in a book, the memory just beyond her grasp. She felt a strange pull to the screen, like gravity, and as her fingers rested above the keyboard, she closed her eyes, and began to type. Sarah took a slow breath. The pen felt oddly familiar in her hand, as if it had always belonged there. The world seemed to shift, and the metallic taste was back, like blood and ash. Then, she began. On the spine of the face-down book, embossed in faded gold lettering, a single word emerged from the shadows, like a whispered promise, or a chilling command: "Begin."
