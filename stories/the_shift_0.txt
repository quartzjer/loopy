I need some starter ideas for a story about a new viral infection that causes illness but is rarely fatal, and patients that recover slowly develop unusual intuition abilities due to the fact that the new dna fragments from the virus increase the quantum efficiency of microtubules in the brain. Scientists can't figure out how it's spreading and it turns out that it was spread by a comet that burned up, that later was determined to originate outside of our system. Max drama.
