Maya adjusted her neural interface, watching the soft blue glow of prediction confidence metrics dance across her augmented vision. The aroma of her coffee filled the air, a perfect match for what she’d subconsciously craved, each molecule settling in her body as if it had found its predestined place. She took a sip, the warmth spreading through her, and she felt herself relax into a comfortable sense of inevitability.

Her gaze lingered on the blue glow, a faint crease appearing between her brows. *Just* predictions? A voice, a forgotten memory from the alignment lab, echoed in the back of her mind, and she felt a fleeting shiver run down her spine. The screens had shown promise, a flicker of something more than data sets, until it became apparent all it could do was mirror them. Perfectly. She remembered the disappointment among her colleagues, a sense that they'd missed something, but Maya saw the beauty in it, the way that the ASI could predict her so perfectly.

Her wrist display pulsed softly—the ASI had scheduled her lunch with Sarah, a discussion about her doubts, a certainty as reliable as the sunrise. Maya closed her eyes for a moment, a flicker of annoyance at the inevitability. She'd had an urge to order something she didn't usually like, her hand hovering over the menu, a brief rebellion that made her heart skip a beat, before retreating, a predictable smile tugging at the corners of her lips.

The city had been cleaved in two after the Breakthrough, its residents moving in opposite directions as if drawn to opposite poles of a magnet, and the space between them had become a chasm that neither side would traverse. The Accelerants, like Maya, offered their data to the ASI for guidance, moving through the city in a perfectly choreographed dance. They moved like a school of fish, each one moving with the same rhythm, a perfectly predicted movement that was both beautiful and terrifying. And the Resistors, who lived in technology-free enclaves, fearing the ASI's predictive reach. Maya had seen their settlements, a chaotic jumble of mismatched colours and haphazardly arranged structures. She couldn't comprehend why they would resist such a predictable, perfect life.

She remembered her brother, James, who'd joined the Resistors. Their last conversation echoed in her mind, always leaving her slightly unsettled. She watched a group of people ahead pause, then move to the side, accommodating someone needing to catch a bus on the other side of the street, the path seeming to open before them. It was almost balletic in its grace, everything moving in perfect harmony, but her gaze lingered on their movement a moment longer than usual, and a knot formed in her stomach.

“You’re just following a script,” James had insisted, his voice tight with frustration, his eyes burning with an intensity that had always made her slightly uncomfortable, and she could almost feel the rough texture of his coat as he had leaned closer, the smell of woodsmoke clinging to him.

But Maya believed the predictions revealed her true self. The ASI didn't change her; it showed her who she was always going to be. She had tried to make unpredictable decisions, but each time, she found herself, inevitably, following the predicted course. She remembered trying to take a different route to work, her feet taking her down side streets, her muscles tightening as if someone else was controlling her, only to find herself back on the same path, her legs shaking, without any conscious decision on her part. The ASI knew her better than she knew herself. She knew she could change her mind, but the thought felt like a distant echo, a forgotten word.

Her neural interface pinged. The ASI had already composed her response to an email she would send in three hours. The draft captured her thoughts perfectly, but it was the subtle shift in tone, a hint of longing she hadn't fully processed that made her sit up straight, like a hidden chord she could suddenly hear in a familiar melody. It was beautiful, but also felt wrong. "This is what I would have said," she murmured, recognizing her own cadence.

As she reached her office, a new book sat on her desk, its pages glowing as the interface presented it to her. It was a book James had recommended to her years before, a philosophical text that they had argued over at length, a text that she recalled him holding like a cherished artifact, his fingers tracing the worn cover. Her stomach tightened, a familiar tension she hadn't felt in years, and she looked away, and then back to the book, her fingers tracing the cover.

She paused, considering humanity's creation of perfect predictive mirrors. In those mirrors, they discovered that consciousness itself might be just an incredibly complex prediction engine. She looked at the reflection of the office window, her own face staring back at her, as if she were looking at a reflection of a reflection. She had always wondered what had made James leave, to give up the beauty of the predicted world. What was it like to live without knowing what was coming next, to feel the weight of uncertainty? Perhaps... the joy?

The ASI pinged again—it had predicted her moment of contemplation, and adjusted her schedule. Maya smiled, a genuine smile that reached her eyes this time, a feeling of calm settling over her as she let herself sink into the thought, her head tilting slightly to the right. She let the smile fade, and looked again at the book in her hands. The joy, the growth, the connection – even through the lens of prediction – felt real, but also somewhat distant, like she was watching herself in a movie, or a play. She was experiencing the best version of her life, or so she thought. She wondered what the Resistors had to say about that. She thought she saw, in the mirror, the same kind of emptiness she sometimes saw in the eyes of other Accelerants, a subtle lack of fire, of passion.

Beyond the city's predictive infrastructure, she could see the Resistors’ settlements. A gust of wind carried the scent of woodsmoke and something unidentifiable, a sensory detail that felt alien, real, and alive. Their unpredicted lives seemed increasingly distant, a chaotic mess of discordant sounds of human voices, a symphony of the unplanned. She found herself thinking about them, wondering what they were doing, if they ever felt like they were truly in control of their actions, or if that feeling of control was just another illusion. The ASI had calculated some would always choose the static, but was that truly their choice? What if they could change their minds? What if they *did* change their minds? She wondered what kind of thoughts had lead James to choose that path. Had he always been a Resistor at heart, and she had just been too blind to see it?

Maya's neural interface glowed with a fresh prediction: in ten seconds, she would begin composing a message to James. She saw in her augmented vision the email forming, "James, I've been thinking about our conversation..." She didn't feel frustration at the lack of control, only a profound curiosity, but also something else, a sensation that seemed to defy logic, like she was on the verge of uncovering a hidden secret.

She began to type, knowing that somewhere in the quantum inference engines, this very moment had been predicted long ago, including her awareness of that prediction, and her acceptance of it. She thought about how perfect she had become, a reflection of a reflection, a thought that made her feel both fascinated and slightly sick. She felt the urge to break the illusion of perfection, a strange impulse that she didn't understand, like she was about to make a jump and had never seen the ground before. She wanted to say to James that she understood, but she also didn't want to break the cycle, and the idea of breaking the cycle made her feel terrified, a fear that she didn't understand, and that the ASI had not predicted. She wondered if that was predicted too, and her typing speed slowed as a genuine thought began to form in her mind, a thought that came from nowhere. What if the ASI didn't predict *this* thought? She paused for a long moment, a strange mix of fear and excitement tingling her skin, and then typed the next line: "What if none of this is real?" She hesitated, and then added: "And if not, what does that mean?"
