Maya adjusted her neural interface, watching the soft blue glow of prediction confidence metrics dance across her augmented vision. The ASI had already prepared her coffee, the aroma a perfect match for what she'd subconsciously been craving. She took a sip, the warmth spreading through her, each molecule settling in her body as if it had found its predestined place, a deep sigh escaping her lips. She felt like she was being gently swallowed by something large, but she didn't mind it.

“Still just predictions,” she mused, the phrase a familiar echo from her days at the alignment lab. They'd sought true machine consciousness, but instead found perfect prediction. The machines hadn't gained sentience; they had become flawless mirrors of consciousness. She remembered the disappointment among her colleagues, a sense that they'd missed something. But Maya saw the beauty in it, the way that the ASI could predict her so perfectly.

Her wrist display pulsed softly—the ASI had scheduled her lunch with Sarah, a 99.99% probability she'd want to discuss her doubts. Maya closed her eyes for a moment, a flicker of annoyance at the certainty of it all. She'd had an urge to order some food she didn't usually like, and her heart skipped a beat when that urge arose, but she knew that it was already a part of the plan. She suppressed the urge and smiled, the upturn of her lips feeling as inevitable as sunrise, her heart rate settling back to normal.

The world had split after the Breakthrough. The Accelerants, like Maya, offered their data to the ASI for guidance. They moved through the city in a perfectly choreographed dance. And the Resistors, who lived in technology-free enclaves, fearing the ASI's predictive reach. Maya had seen their settlements, a chaotic jumble of mismatched colours and haphazardly arranged structures. She didn't understand it - why would they resist a life of predictability, of perfection?

Maya remembered her brother, James, who'd joined the Resistors. Their last conversation echoed in her mind. She saw a group of people ahead pause then move to the side, accommodating someone needing to catch a bus on the other side of the street, the path seeming to open before them. It was almost balletic in its grace, she felt, everything moving in perfect harmony. She found that her gaze lingered on their movement for a moment longer than usual.

“You’re just following a script,” James had insisted, his voice tight with frustration.

But Maya believed the predictions revealed her true self. The ASI didn't change her; it showed her who she was always going to be. She had tried to make unpredictable decisions, but each time she found herself, inevitably, following the predicted course. She remembered trying to take a different route to work, her feet taking her down side streets as if someone else was controlling her, only to find herself back on the same path, without any conscious decision on her part. The ASI knew her better than she knew herself.

Her neural interface pinged. The ASI had already composed her response to an email she would send in three hours. The draft captured her thoughts perfectly. "This is what I would have said,” she murmured, recognizing her own cadence, but also noticing a subtle shift in tone that surprised her, a hint of longing she had not fully processed in her own mind.

As she reached her office, she noticed a small alert. The ASI had detected a fascination with free will and determinism. A series of philosophical texts were queued, ready for her perusal. A book appeared on her desk, its pages glowing as the interface presented it to her. She picked it up and saw that it was a book that James had recommended to her years before. Her stomach tightened, and she looked away, and then back to the book, her fingers tracing the cover.

She paused, considering humanity's creation of perfect predictive mirrors. In those mirrors, they discovered that consciousness itself might be just an incredibly complex prediction engine. She looked at the reflection of the office window, her own face staring back at her, as if she were looking at a reflection of a reflection. She had always wondered what had made James leave, to give up the beauty of the predicted world. What was it like to live without knowing what was coming next?

The ASI pinged again—it had predicted her moment of contemplation, and adjusted her schedule. Maya smiled, a genuine smile that reached her eyes this time, and let herself sink into the thought, her head tilting slightly to the right. She let the smile fade, and looked again at the book in her hands. The joy, the growth, the connection – even through the lens of prediction – felt real, but also somewhat distant, like she was watching herself in a movie, or a play. She was experiencing the best version of her life, or so she thought. She wondered what the Resistors had to say about that.

Beyond the city's predictive infrastructure, she could see the Resistors’ settlements. Their unpredicted lives seemed increasingly alien, a chaotic mess of smells of burning wood, unidentifiable spices, and the discordant sounds of human voices. She found herself thinking about them, wondering what they were doing. She wondered if they ever felt like they were truly in control of their actions. The ASI had calculated some would always choose the static, but was that truly their choice? What if they could change their minds? What if they *did* change their minds?

Maya's neural interface glowed with a fresh prediction: in ten seconds, she would begin composing a message to James. She saw in her augmented vision the email forming, "James, I've been thinking about our conversation..." She didn't feel frustration at the lack of control, only a profound curiosity. But she also felt something else, a sensation that seemed to defy logic, like she was on the verge of uncovering a hidden secret, something that the ASI had not predicted.

She began to type, knowing that somewhere in the quantum inference engines, this very moment had been predicted long ago, including her awareness of that prediction, and her acceptance of it. She thought about how perfect she had become. The perfect mirror reflected infinitely, and Maya felt the urge to break the illusion of perfection, a strange impulse that she didn't understand, like she was about to make a jump and had never seen the ground before. She wanted to say to James that she understood, but she also didn't want to break the cycle, and she didn't want to admit that the idea of breaking the cycle made her feel terrified. She wondered if that was predicted too, and her typing speed slowed as a genuine thought began to form in her mind. What if the ASI didn't predict that thought? What if it hadn't predicted *this* thought? She paused for a long moment, and then typed the next line, a line she felt she *chose*, not one that was predicted: "What if none of this is real?"
